<h3 style="color: blue;">There are 3 things to consider when designing a landscape lighting system:

</h3>



<ol>
<li>   Soft illumination of the home itself this is accomplished by wall wash fixtures carefully placed at the right angle facing up from the foundation. Placed properly this will truly compliment the beauty of your home   </li>
<li>   Tastefully placed Path Lighting to safely guide you and your guests as they enter your home. This area is typically over done and often improperly layed-out to cause black-out areas. We as the installer of the walkways and lighting are most qualified to achieve a well balanced finished affect. There are four different path fixtures to choose from both traditional and contemporary. 
</li>
<li>The Highlighting of your Landscape Pieces. Not everything in your beds needs to be illuminated. We try and focus on the higher-end pieces such as uprights and specimens; typically Bullet- Fixtures are used while Well- Fixtures are used on Deciduous Tree Canopies
</li>

</ol>
